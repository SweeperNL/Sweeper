  <h4>Explanation of our Brand Name</h4>
  <p>
    Our brand name is based on a specific field hockey team position. Typically, a sweeper plays behind the defense to increase security and try to get the ball back for the team. Whether they tackle strikers or steer them wide, a sweeper can slow down an attack. This gives the other players on the team more time to return and defend. A sweeper reads the game, anticipates movement, and adapts — just like teams training without a coach need to do. Sweepers are often self-reliant, leaders, and strategic players, qualities that align perfectly with the idea of self-coaching.

  <h4>Our Logo</h4>
   <img src="images/logos/sweeper-white-green-bg.svg" alt="Sweeper Logo" class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm mt-2" style="max-width: 300px;">
	<p>
    The Sweeper logo was created with intent — every curve, every color, tells a story. The green background represents the iconic grass field hockey field. The symbol underneath the logo is inspired by the shapes of a field hockey stick and a heart — symbolizing not only tactics, but also a sense of community and solidarity. The font, Manometer Sans Regular, mirrors this energy. Its round edges echo the rhythm of play — fast, fluid, alive. Just like the game. Just like the teams we built this for.
  </p>

  <h4>Vision</h4>
  <p>
    We provide weekly training schedules developed by certified coaches and athletes so teams can keep improving — with or without a coach.

  <h4 class="mt-4">Design Elements</h4>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Colour Choices</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>#246910:</strong> This deep green was chosen as a direct reference to the colour of the field hockey pitch, anchoring the brand visually in the sport. Beyond its visual tie to the field, green symbolizes self-reliance, growth, reliability, and confidence — values that align closely with our mission to empower teams to train independently, consistently, and with purpose.</li>
    <li><strong>#F87F10:</strong> This warm orange reflects our connection to the teams we serve — those navigating the challenges of training without a coach. It symbolizes our welcoming spirit, as we embrace these players into the Sweeper community. The colour also stands for independence and sportsmanship, two core values that define our brand and the teams we support.</li>
    <li><strong>#FFFFFF:</strong> White is used to convey simplicity and clarity. By avoiding a clutter of competing colours, we keep the visual identity of Sweeper focused and accessible. As a brand built to support and guide, simplicity isn’t just a design choice — it’s part of how we communicate our purpose: to make training easier, not harder.</li>
    <li><strong>#000000:</strong> Black is used to create strong contrast and maintain a clean, balanced aesthetic throughout our web design. It reinforces visual clarity, helping important elements stand out while contributing to the overall professionalism of the brand.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="mt-4">Font Choices</h5>
  <p><strong>Headings</strong><br>
  <strong>Subheadings</strong><br>
  <strong>Paragraphs</strong></p>
  <p>All our font choices feature rounded shapes, inspired by the curves of a hockey stick and ball — subtle nods to the sport at the core of our identity.</p>
  <p>For headings, we selected <strong>ManometerSans</strong>, a bold and attention-grabbing typeface that mirrors the energy and playfulness of our logo while remaining highly readable. It captures the dynamic spirit we want to convey and helps us connect instantly with our target audience.</p>
  <p>For subheadings and paragraphs, we chose <strong>All Round Gothic</strong> — a slightly rounded, softer typeface that brings a calm, approachable feel to our text. This makes our content more inviting and easier to read, encouraging visitors to stay engaged. We intentionally used the same font for both elements to maintain visual simplicity, in line with our color choices. The font creates contrast between sections while keeping the overall design clean, readable, and visually cohesive.</p>

  <h4 class="mt-5">User Interface Elements</h4>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Menu Organization</h5>
  <p>The main navigation menu is fixed at the top of every page and uses clear, concise one-word labels like “Home,” “About us,” “Contact us,” and “Corporate.” We avoided dropdowns to keep the experience straightforward and accessible. Our target audience is looking for practical, easy-to-find content — not vague or overly layered menus. This direct approach ensures they can quickly navigate to the information they need without friction.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Carousels</h5>
  <p>We use carousels to display our brand values in a clean and engaging way. This format allows each value to stand out individually, giving users space to absorb what each one means without overwhelming them with too much information at once. It also adds a sense of rhythm and movement to the page, reinforcing our focus on activity and flow — both key elements of team sports and self-guided training. The auto-sliding motion keeps the experience dynamic, while indicators help users track their place within the carousel.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Footer</h5>
  <p>The footer includes links to Sweeper’s social media platforms, copyright details, and contact information. It serves as a consistent point of reference, offering visitors essential details without distraction. Positioned at the bottom of each page, the footer acts as the site’s conclusion — a space where users can remain connected.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Cards</h5>
  <p>We use cards to present our training content in a way that’s both organized and visually engaging. Each card represents a different training option, making it easy for users to browse and choose what suits them best. On hover, the cards enlarge — drawing attention and creating an interactive feel that reflects our focus on movement and energy. This subtle animation not only makes the experience more dynamic, but also helps highlight the selected content, guiding users naturally through the training flow.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Login Form</h5>
  <p>A login popup appears when users want to access personalized training content or create a team profile. This feature allows us to tailor the experience to each team’s needs, offering relevant sessions and progress tracking. By keeping the login form as a popup, we avoid disrupting the flow of the website while still enabling a more personal and focused user journey.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Contact Form</h5>
  <p>The contact form allows users to easily reach out with questions, feedback, or collaboration inquiries. Designed for simplicity and clarity, it ensures communication with our team is straightforward and accessible. Whether you're a student, a team member, or someone interested in working with Sweeper, the form provides a direct line to start the conversation.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Social Media Integration</h5>
  <p>Icons linking directly to Sweeper’s social media platforms are seamlessly integrated into the website, providing visitors with quick and easy access to our latest content and community updates. This integration reflects our audience’s habits — staying connected and discovering new content through social platforms. It also reinforces our presence beyond the website, encouraging ongoing engagement and building a sense of community around the brand.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Confirmation Popup</h5>
  <p>We use a confirmation modal when users submit a message through the contact form to provide immediate feedback that their message was successfully sent. This small interaction reinforces trust, gives users clarity that their action was completed, and adds a layer of polish to the overall user experience. It's a simple but effective way to close the loop on communication.</p>

<section id="production-ui-patterns" class="mt-5">
  <h4 class="mt-5">User Interface Patterns</h4>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Media Queries</h5>
  <p>We implemented media queries throughout the website to ensure the layout and styling adapt fluidly to different devices. This guarantees that the site remains accessible to all users and delivers a responsive, user-friendly experience across various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Structure of the Navigation and Content</h5>
  <p>The website is divided into clear, purpose-driven sections to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience. The "Home” page immediately highlights our training content, addressing the core need of our audience — practical, accessible support without distractions. This direct approach reflects feedback from our users, who value simplicity and ease of access.</p>
  <p>The “About us” page builds credibility by sharing our mission and values, while the “Contact us” page reinforces our commitment to being there when clubs are not. Core activities are made directly accessible from the homepage, so users can start training right away without unnecessary clicks or confusion.</p>

  <h4 class="mt-5">Justification of Design Choices</h4>

  <h5 class="mt-3">How does website design fit the values and personality of the brand?</h5>
  <p>The website design reflects the core personality and values of Sweeper: direct, supportive, and built with purpose. On the homepage, we feature the training content front and center — cutting through the noise and getting straight to what matters. Every design decision, from our intentional color palette to the clean, intuitive layout, reinforces our commitment to simplicity, accessibility, and team spirit.</p>
  <p>By eliminating unnecessary complexity, the site ensures that users can quickly find what they need. Together, these choices create a digital experience that stays true to our mission: to make quality field hockey training accessible for every student team in the Netherlands — no coach required.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">How does website design fit the marketing and communication strategy?</h5>
  <p>The website design aligns closely with our marketing and communication goals by making it easy for users to discover and engage with training content in a natural, intuitive way. Simplicity and clarity are at the core of our approach — from the clean layout to the clearly labeled navigation bar that guides users through distinct sections.</p>
  <p>This structure not only improves usability but also supports our goal of delivering a straightforward, no-nonsense message: we’re here to help teams train. Additionally, the site is fully mobile-friendly, ensuring accessibility and a consistent experience across all devices — essential for reaching our student audience wherever they are.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">How does the website design help showcase the unique value proposition of the product?</h5>
  <p>Sweeper is built for field hockey players who train without a coach — and the website makes that clear from the very first glance. The homepage opens with a hero image featuring teen field hockey players working together, immediately creating a sense of belonging and purpose. It communicates that this is a space where players aren’t just supported individually, but as a team. The visual and structural design work together to reinforce our promise: we’re here to help you improve — not just as a player, but as a team.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">User Interface Patterns and Navigation Structure</h5>
  <p>We designed the navigation to be straightforward and intuitive, using clear labels like “Home”, “About us”, “Contact us” and “Corporate”. This ensures users know exactly where each button leads, removing any guesswork. We intentionally avoided dropdown menus and vague titles, opting instead for a clean, simple menu that gets people where they want to be — fast.</p>
  <p>On the homepage, a prominent button leads directly to the training content, making sure users don’t overlook the most valuable part of the site. Once there, visitors are met with a clear grid layout featuring three large cards representing the different training levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. This makes it immediately clear that Sweeper supports players of all skill levels — not just experienced teams.</p>
  <p>The footer wraps up each page with essential links to our social platforms, ensuring ongoing connection and visibility. Responsive design through media queries allows the website to adapt seamlessly across devices, from phones to desktops. Most importantly, the site avoids unnecessary design clutter. It’s simple, direct, and functional — a conscious choice based on what our audience told us in interviews: they value clarity and ease of use above all.</p>

  <h4 id="production-testing" class="mt-5">Testing Protocol</h4>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Testing Goals</h5>
  <p>The goal of our user testing with field hockey players is to evaluate whether the website functions as intended, is easy to navigate, and effectively communicates its purpose to our target audience. Through this process, we aim to identify any technical issues, confusing layouts, or unclear content that could negatively impact the user experience — and make improvements based on real feedback.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Testing Methods</h5>
  <p>Participants will be asked to explore the Sweeper website independently. They’ll be instructed to visit each page and navigate the site on their own, without guidance. The primary task is to locate the training content — this allows us to observe how intuitive the navigation is, how clearly the site communicates its purpose, and whether users can find key information with ease.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Testing Participants</h5>
  <p>Four participants, aged 18 to 24, will be invited to test the website using a computer. All participants are active field hockey players who do not aspire to become professional athletes. This specific demographic closely aligns with our target audience — student players who value team spirit, accessibility, and self-guided training.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Test Setting</h5>
  <p>The test will be conducted in varied environments — both at BUas campus and at home — to reflect the different contexts in which users might discover the website. All testing will take place on a computer, as this aligns with typical user behavior for researching training content. Laptops and desktops offer better readability, smoother navigation, and a more stable experience, ensuring that the feedback reflects real-world usage accurately.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Test Protocol</h5>
  <p>Test conductors will ensure the computer used is fully charged, functioning properly, and has the website preloaded. Audio will be recorded using a phone, and one conductor will film the session. The camera operator will confirm there is enough storage available to capture the entire test.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">The Test</h5>
  <p>Participants will be introduced to the website, and the test conductor will explain the objective: to navigate the site and access the training information. They will be instructed to think out loud throughout the process — sharing what they see, what they expect to happen, and how they feel about the experience. Once the purpose and instructions are clearly communicated, the test will begin.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Post-test Interview</h5>
  <p>Following the test, participants will be asked to share any feedback they have about the website. They will be asked whether the website’s purpose was clear and if they encountered any difficulties or confusing elements during navigation. Additional questions will focus on their impressions of the layout and design, as well as any suggestions they might have for improvement.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Testing Goals Per Participant</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Participant one's goal: Locate the brand’s social media links</li>
    <li>Participant two's goal: Find how to contact a professional coach</li>
    <li>Participant three's goal: Identify the brand’s core values</li>
    <li>Participant four's goal: Access the training information</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="mt-5">Findings</h4>
<p>User testing sessions with student field hockey players revealed several consistent insights:</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Clarity and Simplicity</h5>
<p>Participants found the site clear and easy to navigate. Many praised the color scheme and layout, noting that the amount of information was well balanced — not overwhelming, but still informative.</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Training as the Core Appeal</h5>
<p>The standout feature across sessions was the training content. Users consistently identified the homepage training section as the most engaging and immediately understood its purpose.</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Trust and Professionalism</h5>
<p>While not “corporate” in the traditional sense, the website was still described as “professional for what it’s meant for.” The visual choices — clean layout, bold branding, and logical structure — built trust with users.</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Ease of Navigation</h5>
<p>Most users were able to find information such as contact forms, training content, and team background with little to no difficulty. However, a few initially explored the wrong pages (e.g., checking the corporate page instead of About Us for background info), suggesting a small opportunity for guidance cues.</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Tone Matches Purpose</h5>
<p>Users understood that the platform was meant for teams without a coach. The tone was seen as direct and focused — especially with the slogan “No coach? No problem.” This directness resonated strongly with the target audience.</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Expectations vs Experience</h5>
<p>Compared to other sports platforms, Sweeper was described as “distinct” and “very different from what there is.” Its team-first focus, minimalism, and lack of pressure made it feel more relatable and relevant for social players.</p>

<h4 class="mt-5">Future Improvements</h4>
<p>Based on testing insights, several opportunities emerged to enhance clarity and engagement:</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Highlight the ‘About Us’ Purpose More Clearly</h5>
<p>A few users looked for team background info in the wrong section. Adding a subtle hint or button on the homepage like “Why Sweeper?” or “Meet the Team” could guide users more efficiently.</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Reinforce Call-to-Actions on Homepage</h5>
<p>Although users eventually found training material, initial scrolls could benefit from clearer CTA buttons like “Start Training Now” or “Find Your Level.”</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Clarify Contact Location</h5>
<p>One user checked the corporate page before realizing contact was under About Us. Adding a small contact link or icon in the footer or homepage hero could streamline this.</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Add Light Personalization for Trust</h5>
<p>Even though users found the platform trustworthy, a testimonial quote or a short "Created by players, for players" line near the training cards could increase emotional connection.</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Encourage Story Interaction (Beyond the Website)</h5>
<p>While not directly a website feature, integrating calls to engage with Instagram stories (polls, Q&A) more prominently on the homepage could help boost interaction with Sweeper’s socials, based on low engagement in the campaign.</p>

<h5 class="mt-3">Optional: Add a Quick Intro Section</h5>
<p>Some users guessed what the site was about accurately — but a short tagline or intro paragraph near the top (“Sweeper helps field hockey teams train without a coach — through weekly drills, schedules, and team content”) could lock in understanding faster.</p>

  <p><em> <a href="https://edubuas-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/233837_buas_nl/EqoPLeEnQ9BNp5Z0F0EAyDwBOGAKyk2KTeklSOQrd5rLQA?e=7s9UqD">Testing Report Videos link</a> </em></p>

  <h2 class="text-orange">Marketing</h2>

  <h4 class="mt-4">About Us</h4>
  <p>At Sweeper, we believe every hockey team deserves a structured way to train, with a coach or without one. That is why we created a simple, team-focused platform built to help noncompetitive teams practice smarter, structured together.</p>
  <p>With easy-to-follow drills, quick training tips and visual guides, Sweeper makes it easy for teams to stay sharp and stay connected.</p>
  <p>Sweeper is designed for friend groups, college clubs, even for competitive hockey teams who did not get a coach. We understand how challenging it can be to train effectively without structure or guidance.</p>
  
  <h4 id="marketing-target" class="mt-4">Target Audience</h4>
<p>Sweeper is built for university students and young adult field hockey players aged 18–24 across the Netherlands. These are socially active teams, often formed through friendships or student clubs, who train casually but care&nbsp; about improving together. Many of them play without a coach, balancing sport with studies and social life. They value team spirit, fun, and structure without the pressure of high-level competition.</p>
<p>Digitally connected and visually driven, they spend time on Instagram and TikTok, discovering new training tips and connecting with fellow players. They follow hockey content creators, club pages, and university leagues, and often find new tools and platforms through word of mouth. What they’re looking for isn’t a pro-level drill — it’s a reliable, relatable, and easy way to get better with their team. That’s where Sweeper steps in.</p>


  <h5 class="mt-4">What We Offer</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Team-focused drills that are easy to follow and implement</li>
    <li>Visual training guides for all types of levels (beginner, professional)</li>
    <li>Training schedules designed by real professionals</li>
    <li>Quick tips to boost individual and team performance</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="marketing-campaign" class="mt-5">Campaign Context</h4>
  <p>To support our launch, we will introduce a training platform built specifically for hockey teams without a coach. The focus is on providing structure, team drills and training guidance through an accessible, coach-free platform. Sweeper’s first month campaign is completely organic, focused on community building and strategic posting on Instagram, which is selected for its strong alignment with our audience and visual content needs.</p>

  <p><strong>Core message:</strong> "No coach? No problem"</p>
  <p>This message directly addresses the target group's challenge and highlights Sweeper as the solution.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-4">Promotional Activities</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Instagram posting (2x per week): High-quality posts, visual drills and team-focused content, every post includes a call to action.</li>
    <li>Instagram stories (3x per week): Quick engagement tools such as polls and question boxes to create interaction with our followers.</li>
    <li>Community engagement: Actively liking, commenting and following Dutch student hockey teams and related clubs' pages to build recognition and establish credibility within the community.</li>
    <li>Driving targeted traffic to the Sweeper.nl website.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="marketing-objectives" class="mt-5">Objectives</h4>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Reach</h5>
  <p>Our reach objective goal is to reach and engage 30 accounts on Instagram by the end of our campaign (1 month). For a niche platform like Sweeper this is a strong start. It gives us the chance to connect directly with potential users and collect feedback early on. Research shows that smaller, targeted audiences often lead to more meaningful brand growth. (Edelman, 2023)</p>

  <p>Our other goal is to reach 1200 profile views on Instagram during our first campaign month. This measure shows that our content is sparking curiosity and encouraging users to learn more about what Sweeper is. With consistent posting and direct community engagement, this figure is both realistic and valuable for brand exposure.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Affect Objective</h5>
  <p>We want followers to feel that Sweeper is made for teams like theirs. Our message: "No coach? No problem" helps our target audience feel understood, included and motivated. Through a casual but team-focused tone, we aim to build genuine interest from the start.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Response</h5>
  <p>The campaign is designed to drive specific actions. Our response objective is to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Have 2 accounts engage/tag Sweeper on Instagram</li>
    <li>15 likes per post</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These targets are based on research for small accounts under 1000 followers, according to Biefeldt (2021). Instagram profiles in this range typically receive meaningful engagement and these targets are realistic for an early-stage brand with a niche audience.</p>
  <p>To encourage these actions, each post is designed with a clear call to action caption, such as "Keep growing with your team".</p>

  <p>For the content schedule, we planned and published two Instagram posts per week and created one additional concept of our content ideas. This allowed us to clearly differentiate between finalized posts and creative drafts. The schedule helped us stay focused and go more in depth with each post, both in terms of visuals and messaging. It also ensured that our content followed a clear direction and aligned with our campaign goals.</p>
  <img src="images/corporate/feed_layout.jpg" alt="Sweeper Feed" class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm mt-2" style="max-width: 500px;">
  <p>Sweeper's Instagram page reflects a clean and simple look. We focus on minimalism and use of our brand colors: mainly green with small touches of orange. This creates a calm and consistent style that helps people to recognize our brand. All posts are high quality and follow the same visual style. Everything is well-organized and fits with Sweeper’s message and goals. This makes our campaign easy to follow and strong in presentation.</p>
  <img src="images/corporate/first_post.jpg" alt="Sweeper First Post" class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm mt-2" style="max-width: 500px;">
  <p>This was our first post, where we focused on creating a strong and motivational caption to inspire our followers. Although the number of likes was modest, it marked the start of our presence and voice on Instagram.</p>
  <img src="images/corporate/insights.jpg" alt="Sweeper Insights" class="Instagram Insights" style="max-width: 500px;">
  <p>The monthly overview provides a clear summary of our campaign performance. It shows that we not only reached our goal of 1200 profile views, but also attracted engagement from non-followers, which means there is a growing interest from non-followers and visibility beyond our existing audience.</p>
  <img src="images/corporate/interactions.jpg" alt="Sweeper Interactions" class="Instagram Insights" style="max-width: 500px;">
  <p>We reached 19 accounts, which is below our reach objective for that part of the campaign. In total, we received 52 likes for all the posts. It is not a high number, but the engagement from our followers is strong. This is a positive sign, as it shows we're building a loyal and active community.</p>
  <img src="images/corporate/story_insights.jpg" alt="Sweeper Story Insights" class="Instagram Insights" style="max-width: 500px;">
  <p>This insight is from our Instagram stories that included a poll. While some followers saw the story, the total views were lower than we hoped and not many people responded to the poll.</p>

  <h4 id="marketing-learning" class="mt-5">Learning Points</h4>
  <p>During Sweeper's first campaign we did reach our goal of 1200 profile views on Instagram, showing there is a clear interest in our platform. However, we did not meet some other objectives, like reaching 30 accounts or getting two accounts to tag or engage with us. We believed that reach and interaction would grow naturally over time. However, this showed us that building engagement takes more than just posting — it requires consistency and active involvement.</p>
  <p>Although we created a clear content schedule, we did not completely stick to it. This made our posting irregular and likely affected our visibility. We also underestimated the importance of engaging with other accounts, liking and connecting with our community. This was something we thought that we could do later in the process, expecting growth to come more organically — but it didn't.</p>
  <p>Another challenge was getting our audience to interact with stories. Despite including polls and question boxes, the actual engagement remained low. This taught us that interaction needs to be earned through stronger calls to action and content that feels more personal and valuable to our followers.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-4">What Worked</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Strong branding and clear messaging</li>
    <li>We reached our 1200 profile views goal, showing there is clear interest in Sweeper</li>
    <li>Our tone of voice and message (“No coach? No problem”) resonated with our intended audience</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="mt-4">What Didn’t Work</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Lack of consistency in posting limited our potential reach</li>
    <li>We didn’t engage enough with other accounts in the community</li>
    <li>We missed out on deeper interaction due to passive story formats and less frequent activity</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="mt-4">What We Would Do Differently</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Stick strictly to the content schedule to build consistency and grow our visibility</li>
    <li>Prioritize community interaction from the beginning — not just posting, but also engaging with others</li>
    <li>Set realistic goals that reflect the actual time and effort available, especially for a small, niche campaign</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="marketing-future" class="mt-5">Future Planning</h4>
  <p>Our future planning is shaped by the insights and lessons gained throughout the first campaign. While we successfully reached our target of 1200 profile viewers, we also identified key areas for improvement focused on engagement and consistency. If the project continues, we would take a more strategic and structured approach to ensure greater impact.</p>
  <p><strong>What we will do in the future:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Improve interaction in stories:</strong> Story engagement was lower than expected. In the next phase, we would design more interactive stories such as “this or that”, training clips, and short quizzes. These small changes can lead to higher participation and make the content feel more personal.</li>
    <li><strong>Expand content variety:</strong> Going forward we would introduce new types of content such as:
      <ul>
        <li>Short videos (reels): showing drills in action, giving tips</li>
        <li>Carousel posts: to share step-by-step drills or team-building tips in a swipeable format on Instagram</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The next campaign phase would begin with the development of a detailed and engagement calendar. This would include dedicated time for both publishing and actively engaging with the community. We would also track performance metrics more closely, adapting our strategy based on what drives the highest engagement. By reflecting on our first campaign, we have gained valuable insights into what it takes to grow a digital brand. If continued, Sweeper would move forward with a stronger data-informed approach built on consistency, interaction, and content that engages more with our audience.</p>

  <h4 id="management-lean" class="mt-4">Lean Canvas</h4>
  <img src="images/corporate/final_lean_canvas.jpg" alt="Sweeper Lean Canvas" class="Instagram Insights" style="max-width: 500px;">
  <h5 class="mt-4">Justification of Lean Canvas</h5>

  <h6>Problem</h6>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No structured training / no coach:</strong> Players repeatedly stated in interviews that training lacks structure—drills are reused or improvised, creating a chaotic experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Winter inactivity:</strong> Long breaks result in disinterest, decreased fitness, and skill levels.</li>
    <li><strong>Casual teams get ignored:</strong> Clubs focus on competitive squads while social players are left to self-organize.</li>
    <li><strong>Existing solutions aren’t right:</strong> YouTube and other platforms are “too serious” and not team-focused, making them hard to apply.</li>
  </ul>

  <h6>Solution</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Weekly structured plans, with preference for full weekly sessions or plug-in drills.</li>
    <li>Winter content plans to maintain engagement in off-season.</li>
    <li>Minimalist, clutter-free website experience.</li>
    <li>Partnerships with clubs where captains feel unsupported.</li>
  </ul>

  <h6>Key Metrics</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Website visits to track growth.</li>
    <li>Instagram engagement to reflect content discovery and interaction.</li>
    <li>Drill ratings/saves to monitor which content is reused or favorited.</li>
  </ul>

  <h6>Unique Value Propositions</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>No coach needed — “Structured training for self-coached teams.”</li>
    <li>Focus on fun, flexibility, and efficiency, not competition.</li>
    <li>Relieves captains from training burdens and supports inconsistent or casual teams.</li>
  </ul>

  <h6>Unfair Advantage</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Created by and for students/social teams (ages 18–24).</li>
    <li>Team-based training design.</li>
  </ul>

  <h6>Channels</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Instagram and TikTok — platforms where our audience consumes hockey content.</li>
    <li>University teams — where coaching is often absent.</li>
    <li>Word of mouth and club outreach.</li>
  </ul>

  <h6>Customer Segments</h6>
  <ul>
    <li>Captains of casual teams.</li>
    <li>Casual players seeking structure without high intensity.</li>
    <li>Student teams (especially 18–24 years old).</li>
    <li>Clubs wanting to support all levels.</li>
  </ul>
