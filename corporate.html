  <h4>Explanation of our Brand Name</h4>
  <p>
    Our brand name is based on a specific field hockey team position. Typically, a sweeper plays behind the defense to increase security and try to get the ball back for the team. Whether they tackle strikers or steer them wide, a sweeper can slow down an attack. This gives the other players on the team more time to return and defend. A sweeper reads the game, anticipates movement, and adapts — just like teams training without a coach need to do. Sweepers are often self-reliant, leaders, and strategic players, qualities that align perfectly with the idea of self-coaching.

  <h4>Our Logo</h4>
   <img src="images/pictures/persona.jpg" alt="Sweeper Logo" class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm mt-2" style="max-width: 500px;">
	<p>
    The Sweeper logo was created with intent — every curve, every color, tells a story. The green background represents the iconic grass field hockey field. The symbol underneath the logo is inspired by the shapes of a field hockey stick and a heart — symbolizing not only tactics, but also a sense of community and solidarity. The font, Manometer Sans Regular, mirrors this energy. Its round edges echo the rhythm of play — fast, fluid, alive. Just like the game. Just like the teams we built this for.

  <h4 class="mt-4">Style Guide</h4>
  <p><em>Picture of the style guide to be added here</em></p>

  <h4 class="mt-4">Design Elements</h4>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Colour Choices</h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>#246910:</strong> This deep green was chosen as a direct reference to the colour of the field hockey pitch, anchoring the brand visually in the sport. Beyond its visual tie to the field, green symbolizes self-reliance, growth, reliability, and confidence — values that align closely with our mission to empower teams to train independently, consistently, and with purpose.</li>
    <li><strong>#F87F10:</strong> This warm orange reflects our connection to the teams we serve — those navigating the challenges of training without a coach. It symbolizes our welcoming spirit, as we embrace these players into the Sweeper community. The colour also stands for independence and sportsmanship, two core values that define our brand and the teams we support.</li>
    <li><strong>#FFFFFF:</strong> White is used to convey simplicity and clarity. By avoiding a clutter of competing colours, we keep the visual identity of Sweeper focused and accessible. As a brand built to support and guide, simplicity isn’t just a design choice — it’s part of how we communicate our purpose: to make training easier, not harder.</li>
    <li><strong>#000000:</strong> Black is used to create strong contrast and maintain a clean, balanced aesthetic throughout our web design. It reinforces visual clarity, helping important elements stand out while contributing to the overall professionalism of the brand.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="mt-4">Font Choices</h5>
  <p><strong>Headings</strong><br>
  <strong>Subheadings</strong><br>
  <strong>Paragraphs</strong></p>
  <p>All our font choices feature rounded shapes, inspired by the curves of a hockey stick and ball — subtle nods to the sport at the core of our identity.</p>
  <p>For headings, we selected <strong>ManometerSans</strong>, a bold and attention-grabbing typeface that mirrors the energy and playfulness of our logo while remaining highly readable. It captures the dynamic spirit we want to convey and helps us connect instantly with our target audience.</p>
  <p>For subheadings and paragraphs, we chose <strong>All Round Gothic</strong> — a slightly rounded, softer typeface that brings a calm, approachable feel to our text. This makes our content more inviting and easier to read, encouraging visitors to stay engaged. We intentionally used the same font for both elements to maintain visual simplicity, in line with our color choices. The font creates contrast between sections while keeping the overall design clean, readable, and visually cohesive.</p>

  <h4 class="mt-5">User Interface Elements</h4>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Menu Organization</h5>
  <p>The main navigation menu is fixed at the top of every page and uses clear, concise one-word labels like “Home,” “About us,” “Contact us,” and “Corporate.” We avoided dropdowns to keep the experience straightforward and accessible. Our target audience is looking for practical, easy-to-find content — not vague or overly layered menus. This direct approach ensures they can quickly navigate to the information they need without friction.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Carousels</h5>
  <p>We use carousels to display our brand values in a clean and engaging way. This format allows each value to stand out individually, giving users space to absorb what each one means without overwhelming them with too much information at once. It also adds a sense of rhythm and movement to the page, reinforcing our focus on activity and flow — both key elements of team sports and self-guided training. The auto-sliding motion keeps the experience dynamic, while indicators help users track their place within the carousel.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Footer</h5>
  <p>The footer includes links to Sweeper’s social media platforms, copyright details, and contact information. It serves as a consistent point of reference, offering visitors essential details without distraction. Positioned at the bottom of each page, the footer acts as the site’s conclusion — a space where users can remain connected.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Cards</h5>
  <p>We use cards to present our training content in a way that’s both organized and visually engaging. Each card represents a different training option, making it easy for users to browse and choose what suits them best. On hover, the cards enlarge — drawing attention and creating an interactive feel that reflects our focus on movement and energy. This subtle animation not only makes the experience more dynamic, but also helps highlight the selected content, guiding users naturally through the training flow.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Login Form</h5>
  <p>A login popup appears when users want to access personalized training content or create a team profile. This feature allows us to tailor the experience to each team’s needs, offering relevant sessions and progress tracking. By keeping the login form as a popup, we avoid disrupting the flow of the website while still enabling a more personal and focused user journey.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Contact Form</h5>
  <p>The contact form allows users to easily reach out with questions, feedback, or collaboration inquiries. Designed for simplicity and clarity, it ensures communication with our team is straightforward and accessible. Whether you're a student, a team member, or someone interested in working with Sweeper, the form provides a direct line to start the conversation.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Social Media Integration</h5>
  <p>Icons linking directly to Sweeper’s social media platforms are seamlessly integrated into the website, providing visitors with quick and easy access to our latest content and community updates. This integration reflects our audience’s habits — staying connected and discovering new content through social platforms. It also reinforces our presence beyond the website, encouraging ongoing engagement and building a sense of community around the brand.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Confirmation Popup</h5>
  <p>We use a confirmation modal when users submit a message through the contact form to provide immediate feedback that their message was successfully sent. This small interaction reinforces trust, gives users clarity that their action was completed, and adds a layer of polish to the overall user experience. It's a simple but effective way to close the loop on communication.</p>

<section id="production-ui-patterns" class="mt-5">
  <h4 class="mt-5">User Interface Patterns</h4>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Media Queries</h5>
  <p>We implemented media queries throughout the website to ensure the layout and styling adapt fluidly to different devices. This guarantees that the site remains accessible to all users and delivers a responsive, user-friendly experience across various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Structure of the Navigation and Content</h5>
  <p>The website is divided into clear, purpose-driven sections to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience. The "Home” page immediately highlights our training content, addressing the core need of our audience — practical, accessible support without distractions. This direct approach reflects feedback from our users, who value simplicity and ease of access.</p>
  <p>The “About us” page builds credibility by sharing our mission and values, while the “Contact us” page reinforces our commitment to being there when clubs are not. Core activities are made directly accessible from the homepage, so users can start training right away without unnecessary clicks or confusion.</p>

  <h4 class="mt-5">Justification of Design Choices</h4>

  <h5 class="mt-3">How does website design fit the values and personality of the brand?</h5>
  <p>The website design reflects the core personality and values of Sweeper: direct, supportive, and built with purpose. On the homepage, we feature the training content front and center — cutting through the noise and getting straight to what matters. Every design decision, from our intentional color palette to the clean, intuitive layout, reinforces our commitment to simplicity, accessibility, and team spirit.</p>
  <p>By eliminating unnecessary complexity, the site ensures that users can quickly find what they need. Together, these choices create a digital experience that stays true to our mission: to make quality field hockey training accessible for every student team in the Netherlands — no coach required.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">How does website design fit the marketing and communication strategy?</h5>
  <p>The website design aligns closely with our marketing and communication goals by making it easy for users to discover and engage with training content in a natural, intuitive way. Simplicity and clarity are at the core of our approach — from the clean layout to the clearly labeled navigation bar that guides users through distinct sections.</p>
  <p>This structure not only improves usability but also supports our goal of delivering a straightforward, no-nonsense message: we’re here to help teams train. Additionally, the site is fully mobile-friendly, ensuring accessibility and a consistent experience across all devices — essential for reaching our student audience wherever they are.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">How does the website design help showcase the unique value proposition of the product?</h5>
  <p>Sweeper is built for field hockey players who train without a coach — and the website makes that clear from the very first glance. The homepage opens with a hero image featuring teen field hockey players working together, immediately creating a sense of belonging and purpose. It communicates that this is a space where players aren’t just supported individually, but as a team. The visual and structural design work together to reinforce our promise: we’re here to help you improve — not just as a player, but as a team.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">User Interface Patterns and Navigation Structure</h5>
  <p>We designed the navigation to be straightforward and intuitive, using clear labels like “Home”, “About us”, “Contact us” and “Corporate”. This ensures users know exactly where each button leads, removing any guesswork. We intentionally avoided dropdown menus and vague titles, opting instead for a clean, simple menu that gets people where they want to be — fast.</p>
  <p>On the homepage, a prominent button leads directly to the training content, making sure users don’t overlook the most valuable part of the site. Once there, visitors are met with a clear grid layout featuring three large cards representing the different training levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. This makes it immediately clear that Sweeper supports players of all skill levels — not just experienced teams.</p>
  <p>The footer wraps up each page with essential links to our social platforms, ensuring ongoing connection and visibility. Responsive design through media queries allows the website to adapt seamlessly across devices, from phones to desktops. Most importantly, the site avoids unnecessary design clutter. It’s simple, direct, and functional — a conscious choice based on what our audience told us in interviews: they value clarity and ease of use above all.</p>

  <h4 class="mt-5">Testing Protocol</h4>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Testing Goals</h5>
  <p>The goal of our user testing with field hockey players is to evaluate whether the website functions as intended, is easy to navigate, and effectively communicates its purpose to our target audience. Through this process, we aim to identify any technical issues, confusing layouts, or unclear content that could negatively impact the user experience — and make improvements based on real feedback.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Testing Methods</h5>
  <p>Participants will be asked to explore the Sweeper website independently. They’ll be instructed to visit each page and navigate the site on their own, without guidance. The primary task is to locate the training content — this allows us to observe how intuitive the navigation is, how clearly the site communicates its purpose, and whether users can find key information with ease.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Testing Participants</h5>
  <p>Four participants, aged 18 to 24, will be invited to test the website using a computer. All participants are active field hockey players who do not aspire to become professional athletes. This specific demographic closely aligns with our target audience — student players who value team spirit, accessibility, and self-guided training.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Test Setting</h5>
  <p>The test will be conducted in varied environments — both at BUas campus and at home — to reflect the different contexts in which users might discover the website. All testing will take place on a computer, as this aligns with typical user behavior for researching training content. Laptops and desktops offer better readability, smoother navigation, and a more stable experience, ensuring that the feedback reflects real-world usage accurately.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Test Protocol</h5>
  <p>Test conductors will ensure the computer used is fully charged, functioning properly, and has the website preloaded. Audio will be recorded using a phone, and one conductor will film the session. The camera operator will confirm there is enough storage available to capture the entire test.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">The Test</h5>
  <p>Participants will be introduced to the website, and the test conductor will explain the objective: to navigate the site and access the training information. They will be instructed to think out loud throughout the process — sharing what they see, what they expect to happen, and how they feel about the experience. Once the purpose and instructions are clearly communicated, the test will begin.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Post-test Interview</h5>
  <p>Following the test, participants will be asked to share any feedback they have about the website. They will be asked whether the website’s purpose was clear and if they encountered any difficulties or confusing elements during navigation. Additional questions will focus on their impressions of the layout and design, as well as any suggestions they might have for improvement.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Testing Goals Per Participant</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Participant one's goal: Locate the brand’s social media links</li>
    <li>Participant two's goal: Find how to contact a professional coach</li>
    <li>Participant three's goal: Identify the brand’s core values</li>
    <li>Participant four's goal: Access the training information</li>
  </ul>
